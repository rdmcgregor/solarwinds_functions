# Solarwinds/Puppet Custom Function

This is a Puppet custom function for adding nodes to Solarwinds automagically

Every puppet run the function will reach out to your Solarwinds instance and ask if it is already being monitored. If it finds out that it does not exist it will add itself.

This is a hybrid version that supports both SNMP v2 and v3. Thanks to powellnathanj for the SNMP v2 version <https://github.com/powellnathanj/solarwinds_functions> Thanks to ggrosnick for the SNMP v3 version <https://github.com/ggrosnick/solarwinds_functions>

# Installation

Add this repository to the modules directory of your puppet environment.

Then add the following to your hieradata (common.yaml or other)

A username/password that has authorization to update Solarwinds via the Orion API

```
solarwinds_functions::config::username: ""
solarwinds_functions::config::password: ""
```

The url you'd like to use for querying (ex: <https://sw.yourdomain.com:17778/SolarWinds/InformationService/v3/Json/Query>)

```
solarwinds_functions::config::queryurl: ""
```

The url you'd like to use for Creating (ex: <https://sw.yourdomain.com:17778/SolarWinds/InformationService/v3/Json/Create/Orion.Nodes>)

```
solarwinds_functions::config::addurl: ""
```

The SNMP V2 Community String that you want to use

```
solarwinds_functions::config::community: ""
```

The SNMP V3 Details that you want to use

```
solarwinds_functions::config::snmpv3username: ""
solarwinds_functions::config::snmpv3privmethod: ""
solarwinds_functions::config::snmpv3privkey: ""
solarwinds_functions::config::snmpv3authmethod: ""
solarwinds_functions::config::snmpv3authkey: ""
```

Add the IDs of your pollers so it can pick one at random to spread the load. This should be a comma separated single string (ex: "2,3,4,5")

```
solarwinds_functions::config::pollers: ""
```

Finally, in a profile manifest add the following function:

```
add_node_to_solarwinds()
```
